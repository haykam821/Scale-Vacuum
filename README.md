Adds a customizable void dimension for survival.

Scale Vacuum requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

## Installation

1. Install [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) if it is not installed.
2. Download Scale Vacuum from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/scale-vacuum/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Scale-Vacuum/releases).
3. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

The dimension can be entered and exited through a powerful, ancient chorus fruit. To craft this, chorus fruit and a nether star must be put together in a crafting table. This item is consumable, so round-trips require 2 ancient chorus fruit.  Falling into the void or eating an ancient chorus fruit inside the dimension will bring you back to the overworld at your bed spawn or the world spawn.

Inside the dimension, one starts with a maximum of 2 hearts due to the dimension's air being hard to breathe. This air can be purified 4 times to gain back access to all 10 hearts. A single purifier is crafted with 4 dragon scales sheared off a dragon egg and an eye of ender. The dimension comes with a starting platform made of scale blocks, smooth scale blocks, and unbreakable scale bedrock.

There are several decorations and building materials available. Dragon scales can be compacted into scale blocks, which serve as a deep purple building block. They can be shaped into slabs, stairs, and walls. These scale blocks can be decompressed back into 9 dragon scales. They can also become the lighter smooth scale block which has slab and stair variants.
